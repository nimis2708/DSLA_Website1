<hr />
<h2><strong>Key Concepts</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>For Beginners</strong></h3>
<p>●   <strong>What is Time Series Data?</strong><br />
Time series data consists of data points that are indexed by time. It is typically collected at regular intervals (e.g., daily, monthly, or hourly) and represents trends or patterns over time.<br />
●   <strong>Basic Date and Time Functions</strong><br />
○   <strong>DATE_TRUNC</strong>: Truncates a timestamp to a specified date part (e.g., day, month, year).<br />
○   <strong>EXTRACT</strong>: Extracts parts of a date or timestamp, such as year, month, day, etc.<br />
○   <strong>DATE_ADD</strong>: Adds a specified interval (e.g., days, months) to a date.<br />
○   <strong>Example</strong>: Aggregating sales data by month, using the EXTRACT function to pull out the month part of a timestamp.<br />
●   <strong>Aggregating Time Series Data</strong><br />
○   You can aggregate time series data by specific time periods such as year, month, or week. For example, you can calculate the total sales per month or the average temperature per year.</p>
<h3><strong>For Intermediate Learners</strong></h3>
<p>●   <strong>Rolling Averages and Moving Windows</strong><br />
○   <strong>Moving Average</strong>: A statistical method used to smooth out fluctuations in time series data to identify trends.<br />
○   <strong>Example</strong>: Use SQL to calculate a 7-day moving average for daily sales data using window functions.<br />
○   <strong>Window Functions</strong>: Functions like <code>ROW_NUMBER()</code>, <code>RANK()</code>, <code>LEAD()</code>, and <code>LAG()</code> allow you to calculate cumulative totals, moving averages, and time-based differences.<br />
●   <strong>Time-Based Filtering</strong><br />
○   You can filter data by date or time intervals. For example, to analyze sales in a specific month, you can filter for records where the <code>timestamp</code> falls between the first and last day of that month.<br />
○   <strong>Example</strong>: <code>SELECT * FROM sales WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) = 5 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023;</code><br />
●   <strong>Seasonality and Trends</strong><br />
○   <strong>Seasonality</strong>: The recurring pattern in time series data that occurs at regular intervals (e.g., increased sales during holidays).<br />
○   <strong>Trend</strong>: The long-term movement in time series data, either upward or downward.<br />
○   <strong>Decomposition</strong>: You can decompose time series data into components like trend, seasonality, and noise using SQL-based methods, such as applying a moving average to remove short-term fluctuations.</p>
<h3><strong>For Advanced Learners</strong></h3>
<p>●   <strong>Advanced Time Series Techniques</strong><br />
○   <strong>Seasonal Decomposition</strong>: Decompose time series data to separate trend, seasonal, and irregular components using SQL functions.<br />
○   <strong>Time-Based JOINs</strong>: Use JOINs to combine time series data from different tables (e.g., join sales data with holiday data to analyze seasonal impacts).<br />
○   <strong>Example</strong>: Perform a JOIN between sales and promotion data to analyze the effect of marketing campaigns on product sales over time.<br />
●   <strong>Handling Missing Data in Time Series</strong><br />
○   <strong>Filling Missing Values</strong>: Use SQL to identify gaps in time series data and fill them with interpolation, carry-forward, or backward filling.<br />
○   <strong>Example</strong>: Use a LEFT JOIN with a table of expected time intervals to fill missing time periods in a time series dataset.<br />
●   <strong>Forecasting and Anomaly Detection</strong><br />
○   <strong>Exponential Smoothing</strong>: Use SQL to implement smoothing techniques to reduce noise in time series data.<br />
○   <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>: Identify outliers or unusual patterns in time series data.<br />
○   <strong>SQL-Based Forecasting</strong>: Though SQL is not typically used for full-fledged forecasting, simple techniques like exponential smoothing or trend analysis can be implemented using SQL queries.<br />
●   <strong>Performance Considerations with Time Series Data</strong><br />
○   <strong>Indexes</strong>: Indexing on time-based columns (e.g., timestamp) can significantly improve query performance for time series analysis.<br />
○   <strong>Partitioning</strong>: Large time series datasets can be partitioned by time intervals (e.g., by year, month, or day) for more efficient querying.<br />
●   <strong>Case Study</strong>:<br />
○   <strong>Stock Market Analysis</strong>: Analyze stock prices over time to identify trends and predict future price movements using SQL queries for time series analysis.<br />
○   <strong>Weather Data</strong>: Use SQL to analyze weather patterns over the past decade, identifying seasonal trends and anomalies.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Hands-On Practice</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Beginner Task</strong>: Write a query to calculate the total sales per day, using the <code>DATE_TRUNC</code> function to group data by day.  </li>
<li><strong>Intermediate Task</strong>: Write a query to calculate a 30-day moving average of stock prices using the <code>LAG()</code> window function.  </li>
<li><strong>Advanced Project</strong>: Write a query that combines sales data with public holidays to analyze the impact of holidays on sales over a year. Use seasonal decomposition to identify trends and seasonality in the data.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Additional Notes</strong></h2>
<p>●   <strong>Common Misconceptions</strong><br />
○   Time series data can only be analyzed with specialized tools like R or Python. While these tools offer advanced capabilities, SQL is an effective way to perform basic and intermediate time series analysis directly in a database.<br />
○   Missing time series data always requires external tools to handle. SQL provides several ways to handle missing or irregular time series data directly within the query.<br />
●   <strong>Tips</strong><br />
○   Use window functions like <code>LAG()</code> and <code>LEAD()</code> to calculate time differences and trends in time series data.<br />
○   Partition your time series data by time intervals (e.g., by month or year) to improve performance and simplify queries.<br />
○   Regularly use the <code>EXPLAIN</code> statement to analyze and optimize the performance of time series queries, especially with large datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Level-Intermediate</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>Imbalanced datasets are prevalent in real-world machine learning
problems, where one class significantly outnumbers others. Examples
include fraud detection, rare disease diagnosis, and anomaly detection.
When training models on imbalanced datasets, the algorithms often
prioritize the majority class, leading to biased models with poor
predictive performance for the minority class. Addressing this issue
involves understanding the nature of imbalance, employing specific
preprocessing techniques, using appropriate evaluation metrics, and
deploying robust models that can handle imbalance during inference.</p>
<h3><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define imbalanced datasets and understand the challenges they
    present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore techniques to preprocess and balance datasets effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply evaluation metrics that provide meaningful insights for
    imbalanced datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement strategies for handling imbalance in real-world deployment
    scenarios.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Prerequisites</strong></h3>
<p>To fully engage with this material, you should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Familiarity with classification problems and evaluation metrics like
    precision, recall, and F1-score.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic knowledge of Python programming and machine learning libraries
    (e.g., Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An understanding of data preprocessing techniques.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Key Concepts</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>1. Understanding Imbalanced Datasets</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:</p>
<p>An imbalanced dataset has unequal representation of classes, where one
or more classes (the majority class) dominate while others (the minority
class) are underrepresented.</p>
<p><strong>Common Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fraud detection: Legitimate transactions outnumber fraudulent ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical diagnosis: Positive cases for rare diseases are much fewer
    than negative cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Churn prediction: Most customers do not churn, leading to a dominant
    majority class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges with Imbalanced Datasets</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Biased Predictions</strong>:</p>
<p>a.  Models trained on imbalanced data tend to favor the majority
    class, leading to poor predictive performance for the minority
    class.</p>
<p>b.  Example: A model predicting 99% of transactions as legitimate
    could still achieve high accuracy but fail to detect fraud
    effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Misleading Metrics</strong>:</p>
<p>a.  Accuracy alone may not reflect the true performance of the model
    on minority classes.</p>
<p>b.  Example: In a dataset with 95% majority class and 5% minority
    class, a model predicting all samples as the majority class
    would achieve 95% accuracy but have 0% recall for the minority
    class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Data for Minority Classes</strong>:</p>
<p>a.  Fewer training samples for the minority class make it harder for
    the model to learn meaningful patterns.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>2. Causes of Imbalance</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Natural Occurrence</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain phenomena are inherently rare (e.g., diseases, equipment
    failures).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Collection Bias</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sampling processes might underrepresent certain groups (e.g.,
    socio-economic data).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Design Constraints</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operational focus on majority cases might limit minority data
    collection (e.g., fraud detection systems optimized for speed).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>3. Strategies for Handling Imbalanced Datasets</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1. Resampling Techniques</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oversampling the Minority Class</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Random Oversampling</strong>: Duplicates existing minority class samples
    to increase their representation.</li>
</ul>
<p>python</p>
<p>Copy code</p>
<p>from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler\
ros = RandomOverSampler()\
X_resampled, y_resampled = ros.fit_resample(X, y)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>Generates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority
class samples.</p>
<p>python</p>
<p>Copy code</p>
<p>from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\
smote = SMOTE()\
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)</p>
<p><strong>Undersampling the Majority Class</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces the number of samples in the majority class to balance the
    dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>python</p>
<p>Copy code</p>
<p>from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler\
rus = RandomUnderSampler()\
X_resampled, y_resampled = rus.fit_resample(X, y)</p>
<p><strong>Combination Sampling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances the dataset by combining oversampling and undersampling
    techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations of Resampling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oversampling can lead to overfitting on the minority class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undersampling may discard valuable information from the majority
    class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Cost-Sensitive Learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modify algorithms to penalize misclassifications of the minority
    class more heavily.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Weighted Loss Functions</em>: Assign higher weights to minority
    class errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example: Using Scikit-learn\'s class_weight=\'balanced\' to
    automatically compute weights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>python</p>
<p>Copy code</p>
<p>from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\
model = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight=\'balanced\')\
model.fit(X_train, y_train)</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom weights can also be specified based on the class imbalance
    ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p>python</p>
<p>Copy code</p>
<p>weights = {0: 1, 1: 10} # Assigning higher weight to the minority
class\
model = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight=weights)\
model.fit(X_train, y_train)</p>
<p><strong>3. Advanced Sampling Techniques</strong></p>
<p><strong>ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An improvement over SMOTE that focuses on generating synthetic
    samples for harder-to-classify instances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Borderline-SMOTE</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focuses on generating synthetic samples near decision boundaries to
    improve classification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Choosing Appropriate Metrics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use metrics that account for class imbalance and focus on the
    performance of the minority class.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Precision</strong>: Percentage of true positive predictions out of
    all positive predictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recall (Sensitivity)</strong>: Percentage of true positives detected
    out of all actual positives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>F1-Score</strong>: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing
    both metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ROC-AUC</strong>: Measures the trade-off between true positive rate
    and false positive rate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>python</p>
<p>Copy code</p>
<p>from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\
print(roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba))</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confusion Matrix</strong>: Provides a detailed breakdown of true
    positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>python</p>
<p>Copy code</p>
<p>from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))</p>
<h4><strong>4. Handling Imbalanced Data During Deployment</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Real-Time Considerations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor incoming data streams for class imbalance during inference.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threshold Adjustment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize the classification threshold to balance precision and
    recall.</li>
</ul>
<p>python</p>
<p>Copy code</p>
<p>from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve\
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_test,
y_pred_proba)</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Retraining</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodically retrain models with updated data to reflect real-world
    changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Integrated Pipelines</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate resampling, cost-sensitive learning, and evaluation into
    deployment pipelines.</li>
</ul>
